HTTPSeal is a Linux command-line tool for intercepting and analyzing HTTPS traffic from specific processes using namespace isolation and DNS hijacking.

## About the Name

**HTTPSeal** combines two powerful concepts:

- **HTTPS**: The secure web protocol this tool specializes in intercepting and analyzing
- **Seal**: Representing the secure **encapsulation** and **isolation** of process traffic within a controlled environment

The name embodies the tool's core philosophy: creating a "sealed" environment where HTTPS traffic can be precisely monitored without affecting the broader system‚Äîlike sealing a process in an isolated chamber for examination.

### A Playful Nod to Wireshark

Yes, we'll admit it‚Äî**HTTPSeal** deliberately echoes the naming pattern of **Wireshark**, the legendary network analysis tool! ü¶à

Just as Wireshark combines:
- **Wire** (network cables/connections) + **Shark** (a fierce predator that hunts through data)

HTTPSeal playfully follows suit:
- **HTTPS** (secure web protocol) + **Seal** (an agile marine hunter that "seals" its prey)

While Wireshark is the apex predator of the entire network ocean, HTTPSeal is the specialized hunter that focuses precisely on HTTPS streams within isolated process territories. Think of it as evolving from a broad-spectrum network shark to a precision-targeted process seal! üåä

## Features

- **Process-specific interception**: Only captures traffic from processes launched by HTTPSeal
- **Zero-configuration transparency**: Target applications require no proxy configuration
- **HTTPS/TLS decryption**: Performs MITM with dynamic certificate generation
- **Non-root execution**: Uses Linux Capabilities instead of full root privileges
- **Real-time traffic display**: Shows HTTP/HTTPS request and response details
- **Multiple output formats**: Text, JSON, and CSV with configurable verbosity
- **Advanced filtering**: Domain filtering, content-type exclusion, body size limits

## Architecture

HTTPSeal combines several Linux technologies to create isolated HTTPS interception:

1. **Mount Namespace Isolation**: Creates isolated filesystem views using `unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)`
2. **DNS Hijacking**: Replaces `/etc/resolv.conf` to redirect DNS queries to local server
3. **IP Address Mapping**: Maps domain names to localhost addresses (127.0.0.0/8 range)
4. **HTTPS Proxy**: Intercepts traffic on port 443 and performs MITM decryption
5. **Certificate Authority**: Dynamically generates and caches certificates for target domains
6. **Automatic CA Integration**: Merges HTTPSeal CA with system CA bundle in isolated namespace
7. **Environment Configuration**: Sets SSL/TLS environment variables for seamless certificate usage

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux
- **Go Version**: 1.24.4 or later
- **Linux Capabilities**: 
  - `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`: For creating mount namespaces
  - `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`: For binding to privileged ports

## Certificate Management

HTTPSeal uses **automatic certificate management** - no manual CA installation required:

### Fully Automatic Operation

HTTPSeal **automatically** handles all certificate management when it runs:

1. **CA Generation**: Creates a root CA certificate on first run (stored in `ca/` directory)
2. **Bundle Merging**: Combines HTTPSeal's CA with your system's existing CA certificates  
3. **Namespace Installation**: Uses bind mounts to overlay the merged CA bundle to `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` **within the isolated namespace only**
4. **Environment Setup**: Configures SSL/TLS environment variables (`SSL_CERT_FILE`, `CURL_CA_BUNDLE`, `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, etc.)
5. **Dynamic Certificates**: Generates domain-specific certificates on-demand during interception

### Key Benefits

‚úÖ **Zero Manual Setup**: No need to install CA certificates in your system's trust store

‚úÖ **Complete Isolation**: CA certificates only exist within HTTPSeal's namespace - your system remains untouched

‚úÖ **Automatic Cleanup**: All certificate changes are automatically cleaned up when HTTPSeal exits

‚úÖ **Transparent Operation**: Target applications see the certificates as if they were system-installed

### No System Pollution

Unlike other HTTPS interception tools, HTTPSeal **never modifies your system's certificate store**. All certificate handling happens within the isolated namespace, providing both security and convenience.

## Advantages and Limitations

### Key Advantages

‚úÖ **Process-Specific Isolation**: Only intercepts traffic from processes launched by HTTPSeal - no system-wide impact

‚úÖ **Zero Configuration**: Target applications require no proxy settings or code modifications

‚úÖ **Namespace Security**: Uses Linux mount namespaces for secure isolation without polluting system environment

‚úÖ **Automatic Certificate Handling**: Completely automatic CA certificate management within isolated environment - no manual installation required

‚úÖ **Transparent Interception**: Applications connect normally to domain names without knowing they're monitored

‚úÖ **Advanced Filtering**: Domain filtering, content-type exclusions, and configurable output formats

‚úÖ **Capability-Based Security**: Requires specific Linux capabilities instead of full root access

### Limitations

‚ùå **Linux Only**: Completely platform-specific - cannot work on Windows, macOS, or other systems

‚ùå **DNS Resolution Dependencies**: Applications using hard-coded IPs or custom DNS may bypass interception

‚ùå **Single Process Scope**: Cannot intercept traffic from processes not launched by HTTPSeal

‚ùå **Port 443 Monopolization**: Prevents other HTTPS services on localhost during operation

‚ùå **Limited Protocol Support**: Focuses on HTTP/HTTPS - no WebSocket, HTTP/2, or HTTP/3 support

‚ùå **Application Compatibility**: Some applications may not respect CA environment variables

‚ùå **No Interactive Manipulation**: Read-only traffic logging - cannot modify requests/responses in real-time

### Comparison with Other Tools

| Feature | HTTPSeal | mitmproxy | Burp Suite |
|---------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Process Isolation | ‚úÖ Excellent | ‚ùå Global proxy | ‚ùå Global proxy |
| Zero Config | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå Proxy setup required | ‚ùå Proxy setup required |

### Best Use Cases

üéØ **Perfect For**:
- Linux development and debugging environments
- CLI tool traffic analysis (`wget`, `curl`, custom applications)
- CI/CD pipeline integration with traffic inspection
- Malware analysis in isolated environments
- API integration testing and debugging

üö´ **Not Suitable For**:
- Cross-platform development
- Web browser traffic interception
- Interactive request/response modification
- Production environment monitoring
- High-volume or enterprise traffic analysis

## Security Considerations

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WIP Security Warning**: As a work-in-progress tool, HTTPSeal may contain security vulnerabilities, incomplete input validation, or unstable certificate handling. Do NOT use in production environments or with sensitive data.

- **Use only for authorized testing**: HTTPSeal performs MITM attacks on network traffic
- **Development environments only**: Designed for development and testing scenarios
- **Capability model**: While safer than full root, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` is still a powerful privilege
- **Namespace isolation**: Changes are contained within process namespaces and automatically cleaned up
- **No system modification**: HTTPSeal never modifies your system's certificate store or global network settings
