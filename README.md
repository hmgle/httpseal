HTTPSeal is a Linux command-line tool for intercepting and analyzing HTTPS/HTTP traffic from specific processes using namespace isolation and DNS hijacking.

## About the Name

**HTTPSeal** combines two powerful concepts:

- **HTTPS**: The secure web protocol this tool specializes in intercepting and analyzing
- **HTTP**: Plain text web protocol also supported for complete traffic visibility
- **Seal**: Representing the secure **encapsulation** and **isolation** of process traffic within a controlled environment

The name embodies the tool's core philosophy: creating a "sealed" environment where HTTPS/HTTP traffic can be precisely monitored without affecting the broader system‚Äîlike sealing a process in an isolated chamber for examination.

### A Playful Nod to Wireshark

Yes, we'll admit it‚Äî**HTTPSeal** deliberately echoes the naming pattern of **Wireshark**, the legendary network analysis tool! ü¶à

Just as Wireshark combines:
- **Wire** (network cables/connections) + **Shark** (a fierce predator that hunts through data)

HTTPSeal playfully follows suit:
- **HTTPS** (secure web protocol) + **Seal** (an agile marine hunter that "seals" its prey)

While Wireshark is the apex predator of the entire network ocean, HTTPSeal is the specialized hunter that focuses precisely on HTTPS/HTTP streams within isolated process territories. Think of it as evolving from a broad-spectrum network shark to a precision-targeted process seal! üåä

## Features

- **Process-specific interception**: Only captures traffic from processes launched by HTTPSeal
- **Zero-configuration transparency**: Target applications require no proxy configuration
- **HTTPS/TLS decryption**: Performs MITM with dynamic certificate generation for encrypted traffic
- **HTTP plain text handling**: Direct interception and analysis of unencrypted HTTP traffic
- **Non-root execution**: Uses Linux Capabilities instead of full root privileges
- **Real-time traffic display**: Shows HTTP/HTTPS request and response details
- **Multiple output formats**: Text, JSON, and CSV with configurable verbosity
- **Advanced filtering**: Domain filtering, content-type exclusion, body size limits
- **üî• Wireshark Integration**: HTTP mirror server for real-time Wireshark analysis of decrypted HTTPS and plain HTTP traffic

## Architecture

HTTPSeal combines several Linux technologies to create isolated HTTPS/HTTP interception:

1. **Mount Namespace Isolation**: Creates isolated filesystem views using `unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)`
2. **DNS Hijacking**: Replaces `/etc/resolv.conf` to redirect DNS queries to local server
3. **IP Address Mapping**: Maps domain names to localhost addresses (127.0.0.0/8 range)
4. **HTTPS Proxy**: Intercepts traffic on port 443 and performs MITM decryption
5. **HTTP Proxy**: Intercepts plain HTTP traffic on port 80 (when enabled)
6. **Certificate Authority**: Dynamically generates and caches certificates for target domains (HTTPS only)
7. **Automatic CA Integration**: Merges HTTPSeal CA with system CA bundle in isolated namespace
8. **Environment Configuration**: Sets SSL/TLS environment variables for seamless certificate usage

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux
- **Go Version**: 1.24.4 or later
- **Linux Capabilities**: 
  - `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`: For creating mount namespaces
  - `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`: For binding to privileged ports

```

## üåä Wireshark Integration (HTTP Mirror)

HTTPSeal features a **revolutionary HTTP Mirror Server** that creates real-time HTTP replicas of decrypted HTTPS traffic and plain HTTP traffic, enabling seamless Wireshark analysis without complex TLS certificate configuration.

### How It Works

```
Client ‚Üí HTTPSeal (HTTPS Proxy) ‚Üí Real Server
             ‚Üì
    HTTP Mirror Server (localhost:8080)
             ‚Üì
        Wireshark Capture
```

1. **HTTPS Interception**: HTTPSeal intercepts and decrypts HTTPS traffic as usual
2. **HTTP Mirroring**: Decrypted traffic is replicated as plain HTTP on a local port
3. **Wireshark Analysis**: Capture the mirror port to see all HTTPS traffic in plain text

### Quick Start with Wireshark

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Wireshark and capture on loopback interface
wireshark -i lo -f "tcp port 8080"

# Terminal 2: Run HTTPSeal with mirror enabled
httpseal --enable-mirror -- curl https://api.github.com/users/octocat
```

### Mirror Features

- **üî• Zero TLS Complexity**: No certificate imports, no key files - just capture HTTP traffic
- **üìä Perfect Protocol Support**: Works with all TLS versions (1.2, 1.3, modern cipher suites)
- **üéØ Real-time Streaming**: Traffic appears in Wireshark instantly as it's intercepted
- **üè∑Ô∏è Enhanced Headers**: Original domain info preserved with `X-HTTPSeal-*` headers
- **‚ö° High Performance**: Minimal overhead, efficient goroutine-based mirroring

### Mirror Options

```bash
# Enable mirror server (default port 8080)
httpseal --enable-mirror -- <command>

# Custom mirror port
httpseal --enable-mirror --mirror-port 9090 -- <command>

# Combine with other options
httpseal --enable-mirror -v --format json -o traffic.json -- <command>
```

### Wireshark Configuration

1. **Start Wireshark**: Capture on loopback interface (`lo`)
2. **Apply Filter**: Use `tcp port 8080` (or your custom mirror port)
3. **Run HTTPSeal**: Use `--enable-mirror` flag
4. **Watch Magic**: See decrypted HTTPS traffic as readable HTTP in Wireshark!

### Why This Is Revolutionary

**Traditional Wireshark TLS Decryption**:
- ‚ùå Requires RSA private keys
- ‚ùå Only works with RSA key exchange (not modern ECDHE)
- ‚ùå Complex certificate management
- ‚ùå Limited TLS 1.3 support

**HTTPSeal Mirror Approach**:
- ‚úÖ Works with ALL TLS versions and cipher suites
- ‚úÖ Zero certificate configuration
- ‚úÖ Real-time streaming
- ‚úÖ Perfect for modern HTTPS (TLS 1.3, ECDHE, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Combines HTTPSeal's process isolation with Wireshark's analysis power

### Example Mirror Headers

The mirrored HTTP traffic includes special headers for traceability:

```http
GET /users/octocat HTTP/1.1
Host: api.github.com
X-HTTPSeal-Original-Host: api.github.com
X-HTTPSeal-Mirror-ID: 12345
X-HTTPSeal-Timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:30:45Z
User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
```

### Command Line Options

## Certificate Management

HTTPSeal uses **automatic certificate management** - no manual CA installation required:

### Fully Automatic Operation

HTTPSeal **automatically** handles all certificate management when it runs:

1. **CA Generation**: Creates a root CA certificate on first run (stored in `ca/` directory)
2. **Bundle Merging**: Combines HTTPSeal's CA with your system's existing CA certificates  
3. **Namespace Installation**: Uses bind mounts to overlay the merged CA bundle to `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` **within the isolated namespace only**
4. **Environment Setup**: Configures SSL/TLS environment variables (`SSL_CERT_FILE`, `CURL_CA_BUNDLE`, `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, etc.)
5. **Dynamic Certificates**: Generates domain-specific certificates on-demand during interception

### Key Benefits

‚úÖ **Zero Manual Setup**: No need to install CA certificates in your system's trust store

‚úÖ **Complete Isolation**: CA certificates only exist within HTTPSeal's namespace - your system remains untouched

‚úÖ **Automatic Cleanup**: All certificate changes are automatically cleaned up when HTTPSeal exits

‚úÖ **Transparent Operation**: Target applications see the certificates as if they were system-installed

### No System Pollution

Unlike other HTTPS interception tools, HTTPSeal **never modifies your system's certificate store**. All certificate handling happens within the isolated namespace, providing both security and convenience.

## Advantages and Limitations

### Key Advantages

‚úÖ **Dual Protocol Support**: Handles both HTTPS (with TLS decryption) and plain HTTP traffic interception

‚úÖ **Process-Specific Isolation**: Only intercepts traffic from processes launched by HTTPSeal - no system-wide impact

‚úÖ **Zero Configuration**: Target applications require no proxy settings or code modifications

‚úÖ **Namespace Security**: Uses Linux mount namespaces for secure isolation without polluting system environment

‚úÖ **Automatic Certificate Handling**: Completely automatic CA certificate management within isolated environment - no manual installation required

‚úÖ **Transparent Interception**: Applications connect normally to domain names without knowing they're monitored

‚úÖ **Advanced Filtering**: Domain filtering, content-type exclusions, and configurable output formats

‚úÖ **Capability-Based Security**: Requires specific Linux capabilities instead of full root access

### Limitations

‚ùå **Linux Only**: Completely platform-specific - cannot work on Windows, macOS, or other systems

‚ùå **DNS Resolution Dependencies**: Applications using hard-coded IPs or custom DNS may bypass interception

‚ùå **Single Process Scope**: Cannot intercept traffic from processes not launched by HTTPSeal

‚ùå **Port Monopolization**: Prevents other HTTPS services on localhost:443 during operation (and HTTP services on localhost:80 when HTTP interception is enabled)

‚ùå **Limited Protocol Support**: Focuses on HTTP/HTTPS - no WebSocket, HTTP/2, or HTTP/3 support

‚ùå **Application Compatibility**: Some applications may not respect CA environment variables

‚ùå **No Interactive Manipulation**: Read-only traffic logging - cannot modify requests/responses in real-time

### Best Use Cases

üéØ **Perfect For**:
- Linux development and debugging environments
- CLI tool traffic analysis (`wget`, `curl`, custom applications) with mixed HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- **Wireshark-powered network analysis** with zero TLS complexity for both protocols
- CI/CD pipeline integration with complete traffic inspection
- Malware analysis in isolated environments (both encrypted and plain text communications)
- API integration testing and debugging across HTTP and HTTPS endpoints
- **Security research** requiring both process isolation and dual protocol analysis

üö´ **Not Suitable For**:
- Cross-platform development
- Web browser traffic interception
- Interactive request/response modification
- Production environment monitoring
- High-volume or enterprise traffic analysis

## Security Considerations

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WIP Security Warning**: As a work-in-progress tool, HTTPSeal may contain security vulnerabilities, incomplete input validation, or unstable certificate handling. Do NOT use in production environments or with sensitive data.

- **Use only for authorized testing**: HTTPSeal performs MITM attacks on network traffic
- **Development environments only**: Designed for development and testing scenarios
- **Capability model**: While safer than full root, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` is still a powerful privilege
- **Namespace isolation**: Changes are contained within process namespaces and automatically cleaned up
- **No system modification**: HTTPSeal never modifies your system's certificate store or global network settings
