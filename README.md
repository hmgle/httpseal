# HTTPSeal

HTTPSeal is a Linux command-line tool for intercepting and analyzing HTTPS traffic from specific processes using namespace isolation and DNS hijacking.

## About the Name

**HTTPSeal** combines two powerful concepts:

- **HTTPS**: The secure web protocol this tool specializes in intercepting and analyzing
- **Seal**: Representing the secure **encapsulation** and **isolation** of process traffic within a controlled environment

The name embodies the tool's core philosophy: creating a "sealed" environment where HTTPS traffic can be precisely monitored without affecting the broader systemâ€”like sealing a process in an isolated chamber for examination.

### A Playful Nod to Wireshark

Yes, we'll admit itâ€”**HTTPSeal** deliberately echoes the naming pattern of **Wireshark**, the legendary network analysis tool! ðŸ¦ˆ

Just as Wireshark combines:
- **Wire** (network cables/connections) + **Shark** (a fierce predator that hunts through data)

HTTPSeal playfully follows suit:
- **HTTPS** (secure web protocol) + **Seal** (an agile marine hunter that "seals" its prey)

While Wireshark is the apex predator of the entire network ocean, HTTPSeal is the specialized hunter that focuses precisely on HTTPS streams within isolated process territories. Think of it as evolving from a broad-spectrum network shark to a precision-targeted process seal! ðŸŒŠ

## Features

- **Process-specific interception**: Only captures traffic from processes launched by HTTPSeal
- **Zero-configuration transparency**: Target applications require no proxy configuration
- **HTTPS/TLS decryption**: Performs MITM with dynamic certificate generation
- **Non-root execution**: Uses Linux Capabilities instead of full root privileges
- **Real-time traffic display**: Shows HTTP/HTTPS request and response details
- **Multiple output formats**: Text, JSON, and CSV with configurable verbosity
- **Advanced filtering**: Domain filtering, content-type exclusion, body size limits

## Architecture

HTTPSeal combines several Linux technologies:

1. **Mount Namespace Isolation**: Creates isolated filesystem views using `unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)`
2. **DNS Hijacking**: Replaces `/etc/resolv.conf` to redirect DNS queries to local server
3. **IP Address Mapping**: Maps domain names to localhost addresses (127.0.0.0/8 range)
4. **HTTPS Proxy**: Intercepts traffic on port 443 and performs MITM decryption
5. **Certificate Authority**: Dynamically generates certificates for target domains

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux
- **Go Version**: 1.24.4 or later
- **Linux Capabilities**: 
  - `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`: For creating mount namespaces
  - `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`: For binding to privileged ports

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Intercept wget traffic
httpseal -- wget https://api.github.com/users/octocat

httpseal -- curl -v https://httpbin.org/get

# Intercept any command
httpseal -- python3 -c "import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlopen('https://example.com')"
```

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Verbose mode with all traffic details
httpseal -v -- curl -v https://httpbin.org/get

# Save traffic to file in JSON format
httpseal -o traffic.json --format json -- wget https://baidu.com

# Quiet mode - only save to file, no console output
httpseal -q -o traffic.log -- curl https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go

# Filter specific domains and limit body size
httpseal --filter-domain api.github.com --max-body-size 1024 -- curl https://api.github.com/users/octocat

# Minimal logging level
httpseal --log-level minimal -o summary.txt -- wget https://httpbin.org/json
```

```

## CA Certificate Installation

**IMPORTANT**: For HTTPS interception to work, you must install HTTPSeal's CA certificate:

```bash
# After first run, the CA certificate will be generated in ca/ca.crt
# Install it to your system's trust store:

# For Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo cp ca/ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/httpseal-ca.crt
sudo update-ca-certificates

# For CentOS/RHEL:
sudo cp ca/ca.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/httpseal-ca.crt
sudo update-ca-trust

# For Firefox (separate trust store):
# Import ca/ca.crt through Firefox Settings > Certificates
```

## Security Considerations

- **Use only for authorized testing**: HTTPSeal performs MITM attacks on network traffic
- **Development environments only**: Installing the CA certificate reduces system security
- **Remove CA when done**: Uninstall the CA certificate when not actively using HTTPSeal
- **Capability model**: While safer than full root, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` is still a powerful privilege
